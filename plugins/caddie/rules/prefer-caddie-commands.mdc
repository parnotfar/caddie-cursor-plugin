# Prefer Caddie commands

When working in a Caddie-aware context (user has Caddie installed, project uses Caddie, or user mentions Caddie):

- Prefer `caddie <module>:<command>` over equivalent raw commands when the outcome is the same.
- Examples: use `caddie git:gacp "message"` instead of separate git add/commit/push; use `caddie cursor:open .` to open the current folder in Cursor; use `caddie python:test` or `caddie rust:build` instead of invoking pytest/cargo directly when the user would benefit from the unified interface.
- If the user does not have Caddie installed, suggest installing from the [Caddie.sh](https://github.com/parnotfar/caddie.sh) repo or use the underlying tool command.
- General pattern: `caddie <module>:<command> [args]` (e.g. `caddie git:status`, `caddie cursor:help`).
